# NOTTSTUTOR - Software Engineering Group Project by Group 2A

## About the Project

The purpose of the NottsTutor project is to create a system that can help personal tutors execute their tasks with ease. The main aim is to create a system that helps automate the process of assigning tutors to students, which is currently being done manually by the senior tutors. In the meantime, the system would also cater to the needs of tutors such as being able to always view updated tutee information, keeping records of studentsâ€™ information and managing their information through the system as compared to the manual way of keeping the records in an excel sheet. The NottsTutor website is developed with the aim of improving the existing system and providing a more functional, robust system that will reduce the workload of senior tutors.

## How to Run

First, download the Software-Grp-2A ZIP file and extract the Software-Grp-2A folder.
The Software-Grp-2A folder should contain the following folders and files:

- Codes folder: the NottsTutor code
- csv_db .sql: the database used for NottsTutor
- README.txt/README.md: README file on how to run the code
- CSV Files folder: a folder containing the CSV files of student information  
    The following are the files inside the CSV Files folder:  
      - student_data.csv: a CSV file containing information about all new intake students  
      - existingStudents.csv: a CSV file containing information about already existing students at the University of Nottingham Malaysia  


### XAMPP and Localhost

#### Installing XAMPP
To run the NottsTutor code, it is required that XAMPP is installed to allow for access and use of the system.
The following link by wikihow.com provides exact instructions on how to download and install XAMPP on your computer:
https://www.wikihow.com/Install-XAMPP-for-Windows

#### Uploading the Database
1. Run XAMPP

2. Click the start button for Apache and MySQL

3. Type in localhost in your browser. It should open to the XAMPP dashboard.

4. Click on phpMyAdmin

This should open the phpyMyAdmin dashboard.

5. Create a new database by clicking on 'Create' on the left side panel.

![create database](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62388054/115763638-57a47f00-a3ad-11eb-9753-931d514a77ba.png)

6. Type in the name csv_db 15 and click create.

**Make sure that the name of the database created is csv_db 15 so the SQL file can be imported correctly.**

7. Click on the 'Import' button in the top bar.

Then scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the 'Go' button.

9. After successfully importing the SQL file, the csv_db 15 database should have the following tables.

#### Accessing the NottsTutor Website
1. Inside the XAMPP folder, there is a folder called 'htdocs'

![htdocs](https://i.imgur.com/8lSZi4M.jpg)

Extract the 'Software-Grp-2A' folder and place it inside the htdocs folder like in the following image.

### Using the NottsTutor Website

The following are a list of IDs and passwords to log on to the NottsTutor system and access its features:

1. Administrator

ID: 10000001  
Password: 0000

2. Regular Tutor

ID: 50000033  
Password: 1234

3. Senior Tutor

ID: 50000031  
Password: 1234

4. Student

ID: 20050927  
Password: 1234

Each of these users have different privileges that allow them access to different features of the NottsTutor system:

- The administrator logs onto the system first to upload the CSV file called 'student_data' (inside the CSV Files folder) which contains a list of all new students' information.
- The system will then import this list of students and automatically assign groups of students a tutor.
- Tutors can then log onto the system to view their assigned tutees and their information.
- In addition to viewing their assigned tutees, Senior Tutors can also view information about all tutees and their respective tutors under their school.
- Students can log on to the system to view information about their assigned tutor and a list of other students in their year under the same tutor.

**Note:**

Once student information has been imported, an error will occur if the same data is to be uploaded again as this means the data is going to be a duplicate of the already existing data.  

To try out the importing function again as an administrator, follow these steps:

1. Click on the 'students' table in the database
2. Click on the 'operations' button present in the top bar.
3. Scroll down to the bottom until you reach the 'Delete data or table' section.
4. Click on the 'Empty the table (TRUNCATE) Documentation' option.
5. Uncheck the 'Enable foreign key checks' checbox.
6. Press 'OK'. The students table should now be empty
7. Import the CSV file 'existingStudents' into the students table by clicking on the 'Import' button in the top bar then the 'Choose File' button and choosing the CSV file.
The table should now only include information of existing students and you can now use the Import function on NottsTutor again

### NottsTutor Website

Another way of seeing the functionality of the code is to access the NottsTutor system online via its website.  
NottsTutor has been deployed online and can be accessed and viewed via http://hfyer1.jupiter.nottingham.edu.my/Loginpage.php  
The functionality of the NottsTutor system can be viewed through each page of the website.

**Refer to the User Manual in the final report for a detailed explanation of how to use the system's different features.**  
**The final report also provides details of all other functions provided by NottsTutor.**
