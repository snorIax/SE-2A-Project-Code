# NOTTSTUTOR - Software Engineering Group Project by Group 2A

## About the Project

The purpose of the NottsTutor project is to create a system that can help personal tutors execute their tasks with ease. The main aim is to create a system that helps automate the process of assigning tutors to students, which is currently being done manually by the senior tutors. In the meantime, the system would also cater to the needs of tutors such as being able to always view updated tutee information, keeping records of studentsâ€™ information and managing their information through the system as compared to the manual way of keeping the records in an excel sheet. The NottsTutor websiite is developed with the aim of improving the existing system and providing a more functional, robust system that will reduce the workload of senior tutors.

## How to Run

First, download the Software-Grp-2A ZIP file and extract the Software-Grp-2A folder.
The Software-Grp-2A folder should contain the following folders and files:

- Codes folder: the NottsTutor code
- csv_db .sql: the database used for NottsTutor
- README.txt/README.md: README file on how to run the code
- student_data.csv: a CSV file containing information about all new intake students
- existingStudents.csv: a CSV file containing information about already existing students at the University of Nottingham Malaysia

### XAMPP and Localhost

#### Installing XAMPP
To run the NottsTutor code, it is required that XAMPP is installed to allow for access and use of the system.
The following link by wikihow.com provides exact instructions on how to download and install XAMPP on your computer:

### Using the NottsTutor Website

The following are a list of IDs and passwords to log on to the NottsTutor system and access its features:

1. Administrator

ID: 10000001
Password: 0000

2. Regular Tutor

ID: 50000033
Password: 1234

3. Senior Tutor

4. Student

ID: 20050927
Password: 1234

Each of these users have different privileges that allow them access to different features of the NottsTutor system: 

- The administrator log onto the system first to upload the CSV file called 'student_data' which contains a list of all student information.
- The system will then import this list of students and automatically assign groups of students a tutor.
- Tutors can then log onto the system to view their assigned tutees and their information.
- In addition to viewing their assigned tutees, Senior Tutors can also view information about all tutees and their respective tutors under their school.
- Students can log on to the system to view information about their assigned tutor and a list of other students in their year under the same tutor.

### NottsTutor Website

Another way of seein the functionality of the code is to access the NottsTutor system online via its website.
NottsTutor has been deployed online and can be accessed and viewed via http://hfyer1.jupiter.nottingham.edu.my/Loginpage.php 
The fuctionality of the NottsTutor system can be viewed through each page of the website. 

**Refer to the User Manual in the final report for a detailed explanation of how to use the system's different features.**
**The final report also provides details of all other functions provided by NottsTutor.**
